# game-of-life

A Clojure project designed to solve the `Game of Life` kata. 
[Conway'sGame of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) it is a
zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
initial state, requiring no further input. The universe of Game of
Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
each of which is in one of two possible states: dead or alive.

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells
that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

## Rules

Four simple rules to control the behavior of Game of Life.

    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population
    2. Any live cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding
    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
